# Running the HTML Project

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the **VSCode Live Server** extension to run the project locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally, you do not need to set up a local server to run the project. Here's how to set up Live Server:

1. Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Right-click the `index.html` file in the Explorer sidebar and select **Open with Live Server**.
4. Your browser will open with the site running locally.

## Running the Project Without Live Server

If you don't use Live Server, follow these steps:
1. Locate the `index.html` file in the project folder.
2. Double-click the file to open it in your default web browser.
3. Alternatively, right-click the file and choose **Open With** → Your preferred browser.

## Features to Test

- **Hello World Button**: Click the button labeled "Prints Hello World to the Developer console". An alert dialog will now display "Hello World!" instead of printing it to the console.
- **Add Numbers Form**: Enter two numbers in the form fields and click "Add Numbers". The result will display below the form.
- **Random Joke Button**: Click "Get a Random Joke" to fetch a random joke from the API. The joke will appear below the button.
- **Unordered List**: Verify your details (name, graduation date, etc.) appear in the unordered list.
- **Avatar Image**: Confirm the avatar image is displayed correctly.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute any included test cases to validate the project's functionality.

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work as expected:
- **JavaScript Errors**: Open the browser’s developer tools (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`), navigate to the **Console** tab, and check for error messages.
- **Broken Links**: Ensure the folder structure matches the one detailed above and all files are correctly placed.
- **API Connectivity**: Make sure your internet connection is active to fetch jokes from the API.
